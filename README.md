# 🚀 COMIC ANALYZER AI: Bringing Comics to Life with AI

Welcome to **Comic Analyzer AI** – the ultimate fusion of computer vision, natural language processing, and generative AI, designed to unlock the hidden stories within comic books! Whether you’re a researcher, developer, or recruiter, this project showcases cutting-edge AI in action, transforming static comic images into interactive, engaging narratives.

## 🌟 What Makes Comic Analyzer AI Special?

- **Panel Extraction:** Automatically slices comic pages into individual panels using advanced image processing.
- **Speech Bubble Detection & OCR:** Pinpoints speech bubbles and extracts dialogues with state-of-the-art OCR.
- **Story Generation:** Converts raw dialogues into compelling stories using a fine-tuned T5 language model.
- **Conversational AI:** Ask questions about the story and get intelligent, context-aware answers.
- **Interactive Web App:** Experience everything through a sleek Gradio interface—no coding required!

## 🧠 Why This Project Stands Out

- **End-to-End AI Pipeline:** From pixels to prose, every step is automated.
- **Custom Model Training:** Fine-tuned on comic datasets for authentic storytelling.
- **LangChain Integration:** Modular, scalable, and ready for production.
- **Recruiter-Ready:** Demonstrates real-world AI skills—CV, NLP, LLMs, prompt engineering, and web deployment.
